## üöÄ Project Overview

This project simulates the backend pipeline stages of a CPU using Verilog HDL, starting from a basic 5-stage pipeline and incrementally adding:

* Register renaming
* Physical register file
* Free list management
* Reservation stations
* Common Data Bus (CDB)
* Reorder buffer with precise commit and recovery
* Branch prediction and speculative control
* Out-of-order execution model

## Phase 1: Baseline Pipeline

### ‚úÖ Description

In Phase 1, I implemented a simple in-order 5-stage RISC-V pipeline consisting of:

* Instruction Fetch (IF)
* Instruction Decode (ID)

This pipeline uses direct architectural registers without any renaming.

* `Execution_Unit_ALU.v`
* `Memory.v`
* `Top_Phase1.v`
* `Testbench_Phase1.v`

### ‚úÖ Testcases

* Simulated multiple simple RISC-V instructions with different source and destination registers.

* Free list allocation with availability check
* Fully functional testbench simulating multiple renaming scenarios

## Phase 3: Reservation Stations, Execution Unit, and CDB

### ‚úÖ Description

In Phase 3, I built a simplified Out-of-Order issue and execution model, introducing:

* **Reservation Stations (RS)** ‚Äî dynamically buffer ready & waiting instructions.
* **Common Data Bus (CDB)** ‚Äî broadcasts execution results to wake up dependent instructions.
* **ALU Execution Unit** ‚Äî executes simple ALU operations (ADD, SUB, MUL).
* **Dependency tracking** ‚Äî instructions with unavailable operands wait inside RS until their dependencies are resolved via CDB.

### ‚úÖ Module Structure

* `Reservation_Stations.v`
* `Common_Data_Bus.v`
* `ALU_Execution_Unit.v`
* `Top_Phase3.v`
* `Testbench_Phase3.v`

### ‚úÖ Key Features

* Fully functional RS wake-up logic driven by the CDB.
* Source operand ready bits handled accurately.
* Simple simulation of dynamic instruction insertion and dependent instruction execution.
* Models the essential micro-architecture concept of broadcast-based dependency resolution.

## Phase 4: Reorder Buffer (ROB) and Commit

### ‚úÖ Description

In Phase 4, I implemented a **Reorder Buffer (ROB)** to support **in-order retirement** of instructions that execute out-of-order. This enables correct architectural state updates, branch recovery, and precise exception handling.

### ‚úÖ Module Structure

* `Reorder_Buffer.v`
* `Commit_Unit.v`
* `Recovery_Logic.v`
* `Top_Phase4.v`
* `Testbench_Phase4.v`

### ‚úÖ Key Features

* Full circular buffer management using `head`, `tail`, `valid`, `ready`, and `empty/full` flags
* CDB-based result collection and readiness update
* In-order commit enforcement and physical register release signaling
* Flush logic for misprediction recovery with pointer rollback
* Comprehensive simulation validating proper commit and flush behavior

## Phase 5: Branch Prediction and Speculative Control

### ‚úÖ Description

In Phase 5, I added **branch prediction and speculative control logic** to allow the pipeline to guess branch directions early and recover from incorrect predictions. This improves instruction fetch throughput and prepares the design for out-of-order execution.

### ‚úÖ Module Structure

* `Branch_Predictor.v`
* `BTB.v`
* `Speculation_Control.v`
* `Top_Phase5.v`
* `TB_Phase5.v`

### ‚úÖ Key Features

* Accurate taken/not-taken prediction based on local branch history.
* Tag-based BTB lookup with prediction validation.
* Full pipeline flush and PC redirection on misprediction.
* Simulates prediction updates and target caching dynamically during execution.

## Phase 6: Instruction Wakeup + CDB Integration

### ‚úÖ Description

In Phase 6, I integrated **Wakeup Logic** and **Common Data Bus (CDB)** broadcasting to enable dynamic tracking of operand readiness. Instructions waiting for operands now become issue-ready the moment their corresponding tags are broadcast on the CDB by execution units.

### ‚úÖ Module Structure

* `Wakeup_Logic.v`
* `CDB_Broadcaster.v`
* `Issue_Controller.v`
* `Top_Phase6.v`
* `Testbench_Phase6.v`

### ‚úÖ Key Features

* Source readiness dynamically determined by tag comparison with CDB.
* Instructions issue only when both operands are ready.
* Simulates broadcast from execution units and observes downstream instruction activation.
* Realistic representation of out-of-order execution behavior.

## Phase 7: Load-Store Queue and Memory Access

### ‚úÖ Description

In Phase 7, I implemented a **Load-Store Queue (LSQ)** and integrated it with an **Address Calculator** and **Memory Access Controller**. This simulates realistic out-of-order memory access with effective address generation, buffering of memory instructions, and proper handling of read/write operations.

### ‚úÖ Module Structure

* `Address_Calculator.v`
* `Load_Store_Queue.v`
* `Memory_Access_Controller.v`
* `Top_Phase7.v`
* `Testbench_Phase7.v`

### ‚úÖ Key Features

* Supports instruction commit behavior for stores and immediate access for loads.
* Memory access abstraction through a centralized controller.
* Address calculation logic using base + offset format.

## Phase 8: Exception Handling and Precise State Recovery

### ‚úÖ Description

In Phase 8, I implemented **exception handling and precise retirement control** to support recovery from invalid instructions or hardware faults. This ensures that the CPU can safely roll back to a known good state and handle traps correctly.

### ‚úÖ Module Structure

* `Exception_Handler.v` ‚Äì Detects exceptions and signals rollback and trap address  
* `Trap_Vector_Table.v` ‚Äì Maps exception causes to handler addresses  
* `Precise_Retirement_Logic.v` ‚Äì Ensures correct retirement behavior under exception  
* `Top_Phase8.v` ‚Äì Integrates exception control and retirement logic  
* `Testbench_Phase8.v` ‚Äì Verifies behavior through commit and exception scenarios  

### ‚úÖ Key Features

* Halts retirement logic during exceptional conditions  
* Supports fixed trap address (or extendable to vector-based handling)  
* Modular design to plug into existing ROB and Commit infrastructure  
* Fully simulated with commit-before-exception and trap-redirection scenario
