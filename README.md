# ðŸš€ CPU Rename Backend Design (Multi-Phase Project)

Welcome to my full Verilog-based CPU backend project. This repository tracks my progressive design of a superscalar out-of-order CPU backend, starting from a simple pipeline and progressively adding more advanced features.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project simulates the backend pipeline stages of a CPU using Verilog HDL, starting from a basic 5-stage pipeline and incrementally adding:

- Register renaming
- Physical register file
- Free list management
- Reservation stations
- Common Data Bus (CDB)
- Out-of-order execution model
- Issue queue and reorder buffer (future phases)

Each phase is stored in its own directory inside this repository.

## Phase 1: Baseline Pipeline

### âœ… Description

In Phase 1, I implemented a simple in-order 5-stage RISC-V pipeline consisting of:

- Instruction Fetch (IF)
- Instruction Decode (ID)
- Register File (Architectural)
- ALU Execution (EX)
- Memory Access (MEM)
- Write Back (WB)

This pipeline uses direct architectural registers without any renaming.

### âœ… Module Structure

- `Instruction_Fetch.v`
- `Instruction_Decode.v`
- `Register_File.v`
- `ALU.v`
- `Memory.v`
- `Top_Phase1.v` (top module)
- `Testbench_Phase1.v`

### âœ… Testcases

- Simulated multiple simple RISC-V instructions with different source and destination registers.

## Phase 2: Rename Logic & Free List

### âœ… Description

In Phase 2, I introduced Register Renaming support, including:

- Rename Map Table (Architectural â†’ Physical register mapping)
- Free List (Dynamic physical register allocation)
- Physical Register File (Actual register data storage)
- Rename Logic (Full integration of renaming system)

This phase forms the core of out-of-order backend rename stage.

### âœ… Module Structure

- `Rename_Map_Table.v`
- `Free_List.v`
- `Physical_Register_File.v`
- `Rename_Logic.v`
- `Top_Phase2.v` (top integration)
- `Testbench_Phase2.v`

### âœ… Key Features

- 64-entry physical register file
- Rename table with 32 architectural registers
- Proper handling of x0 (architectural register 0 never gets renamed)
- Free list allocation with availability check
- Fully functional testbench simulating multiple renaming scenarios

## Phase 3: Reservation Stations, Execution Unit, and CDB

### âœ… Description

In Phase 3, I built a simplified Out-of-Order issue and execution model, introducing:

- **Reservation Stations (RS)** â€” dynamically buffer ready & waiting instructions.
- **Common Data Bus (CDB)** â€” broadcasts execution results to wake up dependent instructions.
- **ALU Execution Unit** â€” executes simple ALU operations (ADD, SUB, MUL).
- **Dependency tracking** â€” instructions with unavailable operands wait inside RS until their dependencies are resolved via CDB.

### âœ… Module Structure

- `Reservation_Stations.v` â€” implements the reservation station logic.
- `Common_Data_Bus.v` â€” CDB for broadcasting results to wake-up RS entries.
- `ALU_Execution_Unit.v` â€” ALU that performs arithmetic operations.
- `Top_Phase3.v` â€” complete top-level integration.
- `Testbench_Phase3.v` â€” full testbench with multiple dependent instructions.

### âœ… Key Features

- Fully functional RS wake-up logic driven by the CDB.
- Source operand ready bits handled accurately.
- Simple simulation of dynamic instruction insertion and dependent instruction execution.
- Models the essential micro-architecture concept of broadcast-based dependency resolution.
